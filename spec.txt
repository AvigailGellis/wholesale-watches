Hi, I am run a wholesale watch business, and 'till now I've been writing down orders in a note app and all was fine, but now as the business is slowly growing it's getting quite complicated... 
anyway, here is what I need in a software system

1-the watch name (this can be multiple words long)

2-watch desc (this should be entered automatically based on the unique watch names)

3-regular retail price (RRP) [this should also be entered automatically.]

4-status (I need to know if I have it in stock, in store at the retailer, sold and not paid for, sold and paid for, or RETURNED [this is very important so that I know with watches Don't sell]) [when the status is "in stock", then all the following columns are empty.]

5-store name (the name of the store [and since a Chane store can have many locations I want the city to be included in the name always]. the name of the manager does not matter, and I don't bother keeping track of that)

6-store address (should be entered automatically for old costumers)

7-store phone number (I never have more than 1 number per store), (should be entered automatically for old costumers)

8-store Email (should be entered automatically for old costumers)

9-date delivered (when the watch was delivered to the store.)

10-price (this can vary on the store, and even the same store can have different prices on the same watch [for example, when I start of in a new location I can charge less and later more]) anyway I don't like when prices are put in automatically.

Questions.

Q:don't you want to record the price you paid and your profit?
A:no. I buy batches of 10-15 watches for 300$ and always charge at least 50$. so I know I am making  A profit, but I don't pay a fixed price on A watch.

Q:does status PAID mean that the store sold the watch, and so it needs to be restored, or can it mean you were paid in advance?
A:no one ever offered to pay in advance, so I only sell by consignment. so "paid" means it must be restored.

Q:don't you want to know when the store sold the watch, so you can see how fast each watch sells?
A:no. you can't predict what will sell and what won't. and if something sells fast i realize it anyway.

Reports.

1: The Watch Collection(phoenix) needs to be restored, show me a list of all the watches the had and sold (and don't have in stock right now)
2: The Watch Collection(phoenix) needs to be restored, but say complained that watches with brown leather bands don't sell, and just take up space on his limited display, I need a list of all watches in stock that DON"T have BROWN leather bands.
