# Wholesale Watches

I am a wholesale watch seller, providing watches to retailers on a consignment basis, where they make payments upon the sale of the merchandise. I need a system to track the management of my business.

# Specifications

## Intended Use Cases

This system is designed to:

-   Know what watches I have available for sale, including their details, so I can help retailers order based on their clientele.
-   Monitor retailer stock levels to prevent overstocking.
-   Track watch sales to ensure timely restocking.
-   Manage and monitor payments from retailers.
-   Identify which watches retailers need for restocking.
